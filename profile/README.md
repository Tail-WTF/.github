        Chops Trackers From Shared Link.
    </p>
</p>

---

When you tap share buttons, innocent-looking random strings are placed in the links you get - they are actually
"trackers" tied to you üëÄ.

Every time your friends open these links, service providers learn more about your social connections such as how often
you talk to a particular friend, topics you discuss, etc ü§®. They can further exploit this information in conjunction with
other data they have about you and your friends.

Tail.WTF protects your privacy by chopping the annoying "tails" off these links üõ°Ô∏è, also makes them look
nicer.

## Features

- **Whitelist-based rules**: only parameters essential for reaching a specific resource are kept. Stricter and more stable compared to the blacklist-based services.
- **Server-side Support**: short link expansions can be done anonymously on the server side. Unknown or tricky links can be processed by code-based rules.
- **Diverse clients**: Easily sanitize links on mobile devices, in IM apps or even in terminal without relying on specific browsers or extensions.
- **Concise rules in standardized format**: link processing rules can be written by anyone familiar with basic YAML formatting and regular expressions, and can be easily parsed by new client apps.
