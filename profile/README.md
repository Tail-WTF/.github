        Chops Trackers From Shared Link.
    </p>
</p>

---

When you tap share buttons, innocent-looking random strings are placed in the links you get - they are actually
"trackers" tied to you 👀.

Every time your friends open these links, service providers learn more about your social connections such as how often
you talk to a particular friend, topics you discuss, etc 🤨. They can further exploit this information in conjunction with
other data they have about you and your friends.

Tail.WTF protects your privacy by chopping the annoying "tails" off these links 🛡️, also makes them look
nicer.
